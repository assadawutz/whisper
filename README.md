## 🏗️ The Nexus Architecture

### 1. The Soul (Agent Framework)

Powered by a multi-persona collaboration loop:

- **Safetia:** Rules & Security master.
- **Miralyn:** Structural Architect.
- **Penna:** The Coder (Tailwind v4 expert).
- **Flux:** Weaver of state & snapshots.
- **Checkka:** Terminal Runner & Evidence seeker.

### 2. The Vision (Omni-Scan Engine v12)

Ultra-high fidelity structural discovery:

- **Signal Analysis:** Pre-scan density profiling.
- **Adaptive Heatmap:** Probe-based discovery in high-entropy areas.
- **Symmetry Lock:** Mathematical grid and list detection.
- **QA Gate:** Automated 1:1 coverage validation.

### 3. The Construction (Deterministic Synthesis)

- **Truth Phase:** 1:1 Pixel-locked absolute layout.
- **Beauty Phase:** Semantic Tailwind v4 wrapping.
- **Healing Loop:** Visual regression testing with auto-fix patches.
